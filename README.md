# Coding_Test

## Description
This web application is meant to act as a coding test for would-be programmers to test their knowledge about basic functions in JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. Test takers start with 30 seconds to answer a series of questions. Each wrong answerd deducts 10 seconds from their time. Once the timer runs out, their scores are submitted and they are taken to a webpage with their score table. They are also given the option to play again.

## Usage
Test-takers use the buttons presented to make their choices.
